Pseudocode:
#set variable keepPlaying to true
#While keepPlaying is true:
   
    #print statement welcoming players to the game
    #print statement stating the rules (best 2 out of 3 Press 'q' to quit)
   
    #make a key that assigns a number to each choice for the computer
    #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
    
    #import the random function - the computer makes its choice randomly from its function
    
    #set computer score to 0
    #set player's score to 0
    
    #while player's score is less than 2 and computer's score is less than 2: -- this means that the game is still on
    
    #computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3 (random function gets used here)
    #player's choices = input(ask player to select Rock, Paper or Scissors)
    
    #start checking user options
    #userChoice = userChoice.lower()
    #if player inputs 'q': --player wants to end the game
    #   set keepPlaying to False -- ends the loop
    #   stop the loop -- whoo! break statement
    
    
    #else if (player inputs rock and computer choosess rock) or
    #(player inputs paper and computer chooses paper) or 
    #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses scissors):
    #   print out DRAW
    #   print out player's score and computer's score 
    
    #else of (player inputs rock and computer scissors) or 
    #(player inputs scissors and compter chooses paper) or
    #(player inputs paper and computer chosses rock):
    #   add one to the player's score
    #   print out player's score and computer's score
    
    #else if(player inputs rock and computer paper) or 
    #(player inputs scissors and computer chooses rock) or 
    #(player inputs paper and computer chooses scissors):
    #   add one to the computer's score
    #   print out player's score and computer's score
    
    #else:
    #   tell the user their input was not valid
    
    #print statement thanking the players for playing 
    #if player's score is 2:
    #   print statement letting player know they won
